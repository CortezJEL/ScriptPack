DarkShadow6 (23:39):
oh

Coolblockj (23:40):
Other seats dont work?
Hmm...
Lazaa powa!

Oh wait...................
xD
Waddya doing
?
DarkShadow6 (23:53):
I clicked in nil
Coolblockj (23:53):
xD so it wont work?
DarkShadow6 (23:53):
need to make it not work if i shoot in nil
Coolblockj (23:54):
And shooting into nil breaks it, correct?
DarkShadow6 (23:54):
yas
Coolblockj (23:54):
We....Lost connection
DarkShadow6 (00:00):
loloops
forgot
Coolblockj (00:00):
We've been hit by a UFO!

xD
DarkShadow6 (00:00):
wat
Coolblockj (00:00):
xD his UFO shot us down
Annnd i just froze
Does the TARDIS auto Remove on destroy?

DarkShadow6 (00:03):
yes
Coolblockj (00:06):
Noooo
Wait
DarkShadow6 (00:06):
?
Coolblockj (00:06):
When the TARDIS is hurt critically, you should make it have fires and small explosions inside
DarkShadow6 (00:06):
it aldrady does?

lol?
Coolblockj (00:07):
Hmm...
Havnt seen
Okay, you should make the Shield a GUI btw
:OOOOOOOOOOOOOO just had a new seat idea
Power Distribution
DarkShadow6 (00:07):
i was already going to do that
Coolblockj (00:07):
Ah
So we have Fly Radar Transport Repair Weapons, Shields and Power
Repair + Damage control in one seat
Shields and weapons in one
DarkShadow6 (00:08):
there are only six seats
btw
Coolblockj (00:08):
I know
1:Transport
2:Fly
3:Radar
4:Weapons + Shields

DarkShadow6 (00:09):
morlike
Coolblockj (00:09):
5: Repair and Damage Control
6: Power
DarkShadow6 (00:10):
1 weapon
2 teleport
3 radar
4 shields
5 distribution and
6 
repair
the distribution will work like this
there will be a limited power supply
yu can route power to three outputs
Coolblockj (00:10):
Would Repair be be with Damage Control?
DarkShadow6 (00:10):
shields
repair
and weapons
laser will fire slower and do less damage
if it gets less energy
shields will occasionally flicker if it doesn't have enough energy
or totally shut off and need to be restarted
(so shields aren't cheap)
Coolblockj (00:11):
Or you can make it get less power each time its hit?
DarkShadow6 (00:11):
and it repairs faster if it has more energy
?
Coolblockj (00:11):
Look at it this way
Shields:100
*TARDIS gets hit*
Shields at 95%
DarkShadow6 (00:12):
that's just health
Coolblockj (00:12):
And you can rerout power into shields to rechage them faster?

DarkShadow6 (00:12):
i already have it inplemented
Coolblockj (00:12):
Ah.
DarkShadow6 (00:12):
health will be repaired with the repair
Coolblockj (00:12):
Okay
DarkShadow6 (00:12):
though that is a good idea
Coolblockj (00:13):
Sounds like a good plan
DarkShadow6 (00:13):
energy to flying, youthink
?
Coolblockj (00:13):
Possibly?
Takes energy to fly?
Takes 30 percent to Teleport?
DarkShadow6 (00:13):
maybe you can only fly so fast unless you have more energy
Coolblockj (00:13):
Yea
DarkShadow6 (00:13):
when you teleport it will take all power
Coolblockj (00:13):
Ohhhhhh
DarkShadow6 (00:13):
so everything else is turned off
Coolblockj (00:14):
Dark
Aw
DarkShadow6 (00:14):
?
Coolblockj (00:14):
Oh!
When you get hit, it can Damage Certain controls?
DarkShadow6 (00:14):
i don't se why not?
what do you mean?
Coolblockj (00:14):
Like this
If the Tardis gets hit on say...The thing that makes it Transport
DarkShadow6 (00:15):
if the laser apparatus is damaged in any way it will cease to work
actually
Coolblockj (00:15):
Lets see...
OH!
DarkShadow6 (00:15):
i don't think i made it stop working, just error out
lol
Coolblockj (00:15):
Okay
You should have a Health bar for - Weapons Shields Teleport and Fight
Flight*
So it can be like this
At 70% things are buggy and are a bit less powerful and slower
At 50% they get really buggy, and Transport can send you to the wrong place
At 0% they dont work
--------------------------------------------------------
O like the idea of the TARDIS being off
xD
I like the idea of the TARDIS Teleport transporting you at a Random place at times
-------------------------------------------------------Wierd it dosnt like Mcfirno
The VM
