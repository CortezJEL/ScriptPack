This ZIP contains all of my scripts after The Great ntuser.dat Incident of 2009 (when I accidentally removed system-critical files from the root dir) and some before that, scavenged from forums and my friends' caches of stuff.

Feel free to use or sample any of the stuff in this folder, give credit if you care enough to. Just remember that anything having to do with InsertService will break:
 - To use one of my scripts using InsertService in your place, go to the model page (http://www.roblox.com/item.aspx?id=ASSET_ID_HERE), log in, and "take" the model, thus adding it to your Models page. This will "authorize" IS to download and insert it.
 - Want to use my stuff in a script builder? TOO BAD CRY SOME MOAR, unless the author of the place takes the model too.

My favorite scripts out of all the ones I have made would have to be (best on top, descending):
 - CoolCMDs 4
 - M1 Garand (I put some serious work into that, not a few days after I finish it Roblox breaks)
 - 8-Gauge Shotgun (Had a contest with xSoulStealerx to see who could make a better gun with his model... I think I won, usage-wise, he won animation-wise for obvious reasons)
 - CamSphere (Saved my rear lots of times!)
 - Zombie2

Unfinished projects:
 - Solarus (Holy mother of a goat I wanted to finish that SO BAD. I may just have to port it to Java using j3d)
 - CoolCMDs 5 (Huge to-do file!)
 - Submine (Was just in the middle of making a chunk-based system like Minecraft has to make it faster... Never finished it so it no longer works)
 - Noob Quiz (I wanted to add more, and make it so that when a player joins they are given the quiz. Pass and stay/use the sb, lose and get removed from the game! Great idea, right?)
 - Water Mage (Never even got a file :C)


I hope my 5-some years of free time put into this game will do something for you... I've gotten all I could out of it: the first steps on my journey into eternal Nerdland, the drive for me to learn more languages and such, and sarcasm. LOTS of it.

Have fun and enjoy life, DarkShadow6.
